## budget (v0.1.0)

Spends a daily slice of the person's 7-day Claude usage window and watches the 5-hour window. Utilization values are 0..1 shares of each window.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state "normal" as normal
  state "wrappingUp" as wrappingUp
  state "paused" as paused
  note right of paused : budget-stop
  [*] --> normal
  normal --> paused : USAGE_SAMPLED [mustPause]
  normal --> wrappingUp : USAGE_SAMPLED [mustWrapUp]
  wrappingUp --> paused : USAGE_SAMPLED [mustPause]
  wrappingUp --> normal : USAGE_SAMPLED [mayRun]
  paused --> normal : USAGE_SAMPLED [mayRun]
  paused --> wrappingUp : USAGE_SAMPLED [mustWrapUp]
  note left of paused : from any state on DAY_STARTED
  note left of normal : from any state on DAY_STARTED
```

Effects and context updates: `applyConfig`, `recordUsage`, `reportMode`, `startDay`

Guards: `fiveHourExhausted`, `mayRun`, `mustPause`, `mustWrapUp`

## decision (v0.1.0)

One decision. The stand-in answers first; it decides alone only where its autonomy for this decision class is earned, otherwise the person decides on a card with its recommendation.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state "askingStandIn" as askingStandIn
  state "routing" as routing
  state "awaitingPerson" as awaitingPerson
  note right of awaitingPerson : needs-human
  state "decided ✓" as decided
  [*] --> askingStandIn
  askingStandIn --> routing : STAND_IN_ANSWERED
  askingStandIn --> awaitingPerson : STAND_IN_FAILED
  routing --> decided : always [standInMayDecide]
  routing --> awaitingPerson : always
  awaitingPerson --> decided : PERSON_DECIDED
```

Effects and context updates: `acceptStandInChoice`, `askStandIn`, `logPrecedent`, `notifyInboxClosed`, `notifyInboxOpened`, `postDecisionCard`, `recordPersonChoice`, `recordStandInAnswer`, `reportDecision`

Guards: `standInMayDecide`

## workItem (v0.1.0)

One thing moving through the pipeline: a change to one project of the monorepo, from request to merge. Runs and merges happen outside the machine; their results come back as events on later wakes.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state "active" as active
  state "blocked" as blocked
  state "done ✓" as done
  state "failed ✓" as failed
  state "cancelled ✓" as cancelled

  note left of cancelled : from any state on CANCEL
```

Guards: `choiceIs`, `retriesLeft`, `tierBelow`

## harness (v0.1.0)

The root actor, held by the orchestrator thread. Takes requests, keeps 2-4 items in flight within budget, and keeps the person's inbox.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state "intake" as intake
  state "scheduler" as scheduler
  state "attention" as attention
  state "listening" as intake_listening
  [*] --> intake_listening
  scheduler --> scheduler_halted : BUDGET_MODE [modeIs {"mode":"paused"}]
  scheduler --> scheduler_draining : BUDGET_MODE [modeIs {"mode":"wrappingUp"}]
  scheduler --> scheduler_accepting : BUDGET_MODE
  state "accepting" as scheduler_accepting
  state "draining" as scheduler_draining
  state "halted" as scheduler_halted
  note right of scheduler_halted : budget-stop
  [*] --> scheduler_accepting
  attention --> attention_needsPerson : DECISION_PENDING
  state "quiet" as attention_quiet
  state "needsPerson" as attention_needsPerson
  note right of attention_needsPerson : needs-human
  [*] --> attention_quiet
  attention_needsPerson --> attention_quiet : always [inboxEmpty]
```

Effects and context updates: `addToInbox`, `publishDigest`, `recordBudgetMode`, `releaseSlot`, `removeFromInbox`, `spawnWorkItem`, `startReadyItems`, `wrapUpInFlight`

Guards: `inboxEmpty`, `modeIs`
